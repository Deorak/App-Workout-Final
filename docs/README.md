For the GUI I've decided to use Dear ImGui https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

The code I wrote for the app is found the files "base_function.hpp" and "allclass.hpp"


The app consists of:

-A workout list in which the user can create his custom exercises. 

-Another section lets the user select, from the workout list, the exercises he wishes to perform.
The user can select the number of sets, reps and weight for each exercise and also the date on which those exercises were performed.

-A logbook in which the user can store all of his workouts

-A note section

-A stopwatch equipped with an alarm and a rep counter
